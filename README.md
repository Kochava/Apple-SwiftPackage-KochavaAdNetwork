## Deprecation Advisory

The contents of optional module KochavaAdNetwork were merged into primary module KochavaTracker in v6.0.0.  Module KochavaAdNetwork is now no longer needed, as its symbols are now always available from within module KochavaTracker.  In the meantime if you have this module in your project it will have no other adverse effects.  Module KochavaAdNetwork should be now removed from your build processes- including any Swift Package references, Cocoapods references, target inclusions, imports, registration calls, etc.  Thank you!
